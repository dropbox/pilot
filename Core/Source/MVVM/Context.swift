/// An object underlying the Pilot MVVM stack which:
///
/// 1. Acts as the primary application pathway for sending actions (implementing `ActionSender`).
/// 2. Provides dependencies and contextual state for the MVVM stack.
///
/// ## Receiving Actions
///
/// Typically, an application defines a root `Context` object at its top level (e.g. in the application
/// delegate on iOS). This context is then used when binding `Model`s to `ViewModel`s and `ViewModel`s to `Views` (this
/// is automatically taken care of when using PilotUI components like `CollectionViewController`).
///
/// To listen for a specific action on a context, it is recommended to use the `receive` method as follows:
///
/// ```
/// observer = context.receive { (action: MyAction) in
///     // Handle action here.
///      return .handled
/// }
/// ```
///
/// When the returned `Observer` object is deallocated, the receive closure will no longer be called. `receive` is a
/// typed action handler method that doesn't require an explicit call to stop listening and is therefore recommended
/// over calling `addReceiver` and `removeReceiver`. `receiveAll` invokes a closure for all actions on a target context.
/// It is typically used when a given object wants to listen for multiple actions.
///
/// Returning `.handled` will stop any further processing of that action. Returning `.notHandled` will cause the
/// `Context` to keep exhaustively looking for receivers to handle the action.
///
/// ## Sending Actions
///
/// The `Context` object implements `ActionSender` and is typically used for sending all application actions.
///
/// ```
/// // Preferred method of sending actions:
/// MyAction().send(from: context)
/// // Although this is acce
/// ```
///
/// ## Scopes
///
/// Any `Context` object may have parent or child "scopes". Scopes are primarily intended to logically layer action
/// handling so that lower-level scopes are checked first before bubbling actions up to higher level scopes.
///
/// As an example, an application may have a `UserTapped` action (sent by a `UserViewModel`). The top-level `Context`
/// may receive that action and navigate the user interface to show a "User Profile" screen. However, that same
/// application may have a control that selects a set of users for messaging. The same `UserViewModel` may send a
/// `UserTapped` action, but the control would want to intercept that action to add the user to a list, instead of
/// navigating. This is where scopes come into play. When creating and displaying the "User Picker" control, the
/// application would give it a new scope (via `context.newScope()`) so that actions in the scope of the user picker
/// control may be interpreted and handled differently.
///
/// ## Action Ordering
///
/// There is a deterministic ordering for evaluating which receiver handles an action sent on a context:
///
/// 1. Calls to `receive` or `addReceiver` add the observation closures to a stack. These closures on the stack are
/// evaluated in reverse order (i.e. last-to-first/top-down).
/// 2. If no closure returns `.handled`, then the action is sent to the `Context' object's parent scope `Context`.
/// 3. This continues until the action is handled. If not handled, a warning log is printed.
